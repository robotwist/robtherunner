# Game Assets Placeholder

For a complete game experience, you'll need to create or source the following pixel art assets:

1. player.png - A spritesheet with running and jumping animations for the character
   - Size: 160x120px (4 frames of 40x60px for running, 4 frames for jumping)
   - Format: PNG with transparency

2. obstacle.png - Obstacle sprite
   - Size: 30x30px
   - Format: PNG with transparency

3. ground.png - Repeatable ground tile
   - Size: 64x40px
   - Format: PNG with transparency

4. background.png - Game background
   - Size: 640x360px
   - Format: PNG

You can replace these assets with your own pixel art designs while maintaining the same dimensions to ensure proper game functionality.

For a quick start, you can create simple colored rectangles as placeholders with the following:

- player.png: Blue rectangle
- obstacle.png: Red rectangle
- ground.png: Brown rectangle with top edge detail
- background.png: Simple gradient or pattern
